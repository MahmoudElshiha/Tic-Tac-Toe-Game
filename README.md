# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

🎮 **A Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

## 📖 Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing two players to take turns playing on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for win conditions, highlights the winning combination, and keeps track of the score for both players. A reset functionality is also provided to start a new game while maintaining the score.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can make their moves by clicking on the grid. The game automatically switches turns between player X and player O.

- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to work smoothly on different screen sizes and devices.
- **Reset Functionality**: The game can be reset to start a new round while preserving the score.
